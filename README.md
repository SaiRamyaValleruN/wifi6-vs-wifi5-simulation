# WiFi6 vs WiFi5 Simulation

This project compares the performance of **Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)** and **Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac)** using NS-3 simulations.  
The evaluation focuses on metrics like **throughput**, **packet loss**, **latency**, and the advantages of features such as **OFDMA**, **MU-MIMO**, and **BSS Coloring**.

## Project Goals

- Simulate both Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 5 using NS-3 modules
- Measure and compare:
  - Throughput
  - Packet loss
  - Delay
  - Effect of channel width and guard intervals
- Visualize results with Python-based plotting scripts

## How to Build and Run

### 1. Configure and Build ns-3:
```bash
./ns3 configure --enable-examples --enable-tests
./ns3 build
```

### 2. Run Simulations
Example:
```bash
./ns3 run scratch/wifi6_custom
./ns3 run scratch/wifi5_custom
```

### 3. Plot Results with Python:
Activate your Python virtual environment:
```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

Run plotting scripts:
```bash
python3 plot_wifi6_throughput.py
python3 compare_wifi5_wifi6.py
```
